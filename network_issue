#this file foucus on SSH/Password issues
1. cannot login to host via root accout with right password
method 1:
1)check the algorithm which is used in /etc/shadow, below is an example in /etc/shadow:
root:$1$xyz$vDWSBUgNH2PMgEmLoHEEi.:16917:0:99999:7:::
this line is splited with ":", the first part is the user name, the second part($?$) is the algorithm type which is used in /etc/shadow
execute command " man 3 crypt", you can see below info:
If  salt is a character string starting with the characters "$id$" fol‐ 
       lowed by a string terminated by "$": 

              $id$salt$encrypted

       then instead of using the DES machine,  id  identifies  the  encryption 
       method  used  and  this  then  determines  how the rest of the password 
       string is interpreted.  The following values of id are supported:

              ID  | Method 
              ───────────────────────────────────────── 
              1   | MD5 
              2a  | Blowfish (not in mainline glibc; added in some 
                  | Linux distributions) 
              5   | SHA-256 (since glibc 2.7) 
              6   | SHA-512 (since glibc 2.7) 
2)modify /etc/shadow file via changing the algorithm
3)encrypt your password with below command:
python -c "import crypt, getpass, pwd; print crypt.crypt('123456', '\$6\$L0Uymjwa\$')"
Note:123456 is your password, $6$ is the algorithm type you choose, $L0Uymjwa$ is the salt you can find in file /etc/shadow
